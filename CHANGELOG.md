# Changelog

All notable Rust API and packaging changes are recorded here. Canonical
protocol compatibility is governed separately by the identifiers and versions
embedded in ZenoFCIS values.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Catalog format 2 requires every effect and channel to bind explicit reviewed
  `OperationSemantics`, including canonical asset-scoped value-flow sets.
- Verified project laws now derive non-waivable economic families and
  committing-decision coverage from the exact catalog. Custom value relations
  require one exact registered claim with independently retained evidence.

## 1.0.0-rc.1 - 2026-07-29

First public release candidate for the reusable ZenoFCIS core library family.

### Included

- immutable values, canonical ZCVE/1 encoding, deterministic budgets, and the
  `Accept | Reject | CommittedFailure` decision algebra;
- preconditioned canonical patches, closed effect and outbox plans, receipts,
  candidate sealing, and nominal production commit authorization;
- project profiles, schemas, catalogs, generated typed transitions, relational
  laws, and fixed-size composable domain machines;
- proof-carrying composition with complete static footprint evidence and
  deterministic-parallel authorization;
- tool-neutral evidence, refinement, synthesis, and checked-backend protocols;
- strict invocation-bound decision reconstruction, derived refinement cases,
  canonical exhaustive-domain manifests, independently verified coverage, and
  content-addressed promotion reports;
- reference authenticated state, persistent collections, SQLite publication,
  mounted-runtime adapters, secret handling, and side/covert-channel policy;
- 33 publishable crates, a diagnostic ZenoDEX mount binary, complete public API
  rustdoc pages, examples, checksums, package/source archives, CycloneDX SBOM
  generation, and provenance inputs. The reproducible offline rustdoc archive
  explicitly excludes Rustdoc `1.97.1`'s nondeterministic global-search index.
- candidate-derived outbox delivery identities shared byte-for-byte by the
  reference and SQLite shells, with SQLite schema v3 rejecting old
  authorization-derived identities pending explicit migration.
- policy-bound, law-verified nominal genesis authorization; one-time pure and
  SQLite shell creation; strict receipt, bundle, and authorization decoding;
  and SQLite schema v5 full-history reauthorization with exact
  authorization/bundle/receipt/replay/outbox set reconstruction. Schema v4 and
  earlier stores are rejected pending explicit migration.
- canonical sparse-proof and authenticated-plan decoding with explicit resource
  limits, exact round-trip admission, and non-authoritative decoded plan values;
- retained-evidence projector qualification, required per-transition projection
  relations, nominal candidate-bound authenticated commits, and a production-facing
  authenticated publication port.
- a checked V1 release runbook, declared code ownership, and read-only
  reproducible package assembly for immutable `v1.0.0-rc.*` tags.

### Release-candidate limits

- no arbitrary downstream project receives production authorization merely by
  using the library;
- the authenticated sparse tree remains a bounded reference implementation;
- SQLite qualification is limited to the documented reference deployment;
- concrete Lean, SMT, CVC5, Kani, Flux, or private ESSO adapters and proof
  artifacts remain project-owned;
- concurrent execution and effect interpretation remain external shell work;
- final independent exact-head review and release attestation remain required
  before `1.0.0`.
